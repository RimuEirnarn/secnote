## Installations

When firstly initiated, the app will enter interactive install. Prompt for global or local installation.

## Modes & Interfaces

There are 4 modes: `offline`, `local`, `global`, `server`.

Cross-platform modes are: `offline` and `server`

### Interfaces

## Note

This app only works for Unix-like OSes (Linux is recommended) since setuid is required for daemon.
And socket file for communicating from client to daemon. (for local, global mode)

This is for fun app, may not be great for security reason.
