# CLI Encrypted Notes

Create a note, edit a note from your favorite CLI tools, and manage notes.

When firstly initiated, the app will install themself globally.
This app only works for Unix-like OSes (Linux is recommended) since setuid is required for daemon.
And socket file for communicating from client to daemon.

This is for fun app, may not be great for security reason.

**THIS APPLICATION IS IN DESIGN PHASE** No real implementation has been added. Abstraction has been made. Reference exists
